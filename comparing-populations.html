                    <li><strong>Longer post-exposure lifespan:</strong> Children have a longer lifespan post-exposure, allowing more time for potential malignancies to develop (Morgan, 2003).</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher relative risk:</strong> Procedures like chest CT scans (10 mSv dose) pose a higher relative risk of radiation-induced damage in children.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Critical structures:</strong> Tumors near critical structures (heart, esophagus, central airways) need careful planning (Morgan, 2003).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example: Small Cell Lung Cancer:</h3>
                <ul>

                <h3>Advanced Radiation Techniques:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IMRT and proton therapy:</strong> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy allow for precise targeting and higher doses to the tumor while sparing surrounding tissues from excessive radiation (Lomaeva et al., 2011).</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced side effects:</strong> These methods reduce the risk of side effects like cardiac arrhythmias and esophageal injury, improving the patient’s quality of life.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Postponement:</strong> Radiation-based imaging and treatments are typically postponed until after delivery, unless clinically necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternative imaging:</strong> In non-urgent cases, alternative imaging modalities like ultrasound and MRI are preferred to avoid harm to the fetus.</li>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>The cumulative radiation dose from the diagnosis and treatment of small cell lung cancer is influenced by various patient-specific factors, including age, body habitus, lifestyle choices, tumor location, pregnancy status, and genetic predispositions. As radiation exposure plays a crucial role in both diagnosing and treating this aggressive cancer, personalized treatment planning and advanced radiation delivery techniques are essential for optimizing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing the risks of adverse effects. Ongoing research into radiotherapy techniques and protective measures is vital to improving the safety and efficacy of SCLC treatments, ensuring better outcomes for all patients, regardless of their individual risk factors.</p>
