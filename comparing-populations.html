            <h2>How Different Populations Are Affected by Radiation</h2>
            <p>Radiation exposure during SCLC diagnosis and treatment can affect individuals differently based on factors like age, body habitus, lifestyle, pregnancy, and genetic predisposition. Here's a breakdown:</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Age-Related Sensitivity to Radiation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Children:</strong> Due to rapidly dividing cells and a longer post-exposure lifespan, children are more susceptible to radiation-induced harm. A 10 mSv dose from a chest CT scan poses a higher relative risk of damage (Morgan, 2003).</li>
                    <li><strong>Adults:</strong> Adults are at increased risk of immediate side effects like pulmonary toxicity, especially if they have comorbidities (Howard, 2019).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Impact of Body Habitus</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Obese Patients:</strong> May require higher radiation doses for diagnostic image quality, leading to increased exposure (Lomaeva et al., 2011).</li>
                    <li><strong>Patients with Lower Body Mass:</strong> May receive higher doses relative to body size, increasing the risk of radiation-induced damage to nearby tissues like the lungs and heart (Bach et al., 2012).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Lifestyle Factors: Smoking</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smoking significantly increases the risk of radiation-induced lung cancer. Both tobacco smoke and radiation are known carcinogens (Woodman, 2002).</li>
                    <li>Patients who smoke and receive radiation therapy are at higher risk of developing pulmonary toxicity, including difficulty breathing and chest pain (Shaw et al., 2011).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Tumor Location within the Lung</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tumors near critical structures (e.g., heart, esophagus) require precise radiation therapy to minimize damage to surrounding tissues (Morgan, 2003).</li>
                    <li>Advanced techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy allow for precise targeting, reducing side effects like cardiac arrhythmias and esophageal injury (Lomaeva et al., 2011).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Radiation exposure during pregnancy poses risks to the developing fetus, including congenital malformations, growth retardation, and increased cancer risk later in life (Shaw et al., 2011).</li>
                    <li>For pregnant patients, radiation-based imaging and treatments are typically postponed unless clinically necessary. Alternative modalities like ultrasound or MRI are preferred (Bach et al., 2012).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Genetic Predisposition to Cancer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals with genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA mutations) are more sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation (Morgan, 2003).</li>
                    <li>Special care is needed for these patients, including using the lowest possible radiation dose and opting for non-ionizing imaging techniques when feasible (Bach et al., 2012).</li>
                </ul>
