            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Why did I not get a shield for my chest x-ray?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing shielding depends on the part of the body being imaged. For chest X-rays, we are interested in seeing the lungs, ribs, and spine. If thyroid shielding (around the neck) were to be given, the shielding would block the X-rays from passing through the area of interest and prevent us from getting the images we need for assessment.</li>
                    <li>In theory, if protection from radiation is of concern, not using shielding with a chest X-ray can reduce your dose since no additional images are needed.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, diagnostic imaging dose ranges are low, so adverse effects from the X-ray are unlikely to arise. Henceforth, some hospitals are moving away from using any shielding at all.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Will external beam radiation therapy make me radioactive?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No, external beam radiation therapy only exposes you to radiation when the beam is turned on. There is no radiation that lingers in your body, so you are safe to interact with family members and loved ones as usual.</li>
                    <li>For your interest: Brachytherapy, another type of radiation therapy, utilizes the insertion of radioactive seeds into or near the site of the tumour. In this case, you would need to stay in a protected room while the seeds are implanted, however, this is not a treatment used for SCLC.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Does radiation therapy hurt?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The radiation therapy treatment itself does not hurt. You will not see any radiation as it is not visible to the human eye, and nothing will come in contact with you during your treatment. However, you may hear some noises or clicking of the machine, but this is completely normal.</li>
                    <li>You may experience side effects that can cause pain, fatigue, or sickness.</li>
                </ul>
