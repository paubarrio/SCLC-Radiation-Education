        <div class="panel">
            <h3>Who is most at risk of developing SCLC?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SCLC mostly occurs in individuals in their early to late 60s and is linked to cigarette smoking, with the majority of patients having a history of tobacco use (Dumoulin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023).</li>
                <li>SCLC represents about 14% of all lung cancer cases.</li>
                <li>Individuals of African ancestry are at lower risk of developing SCLC compared to those of European ancestry.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why is a chest X-ray the most common procedure for diagnosing or suspecting SCLC?</h3>
            <p>A patient with or suspected of having SCLC would normally undergo a chest X-ray (CXR) before other imaging modalities are considered.</p>
            <p>The reason CXR is commonly used is due to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Their low cost</li>
                <li>Easy accessibility</li>
                <li>Minimal radiation exposure, with a single CXR involving a dose of approximately 0.02 mSv (Bradley et al., 2019; Public Health England, 2008).</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While the radiation dose from a single CXR is minimal, repeated X-rays over time can add up.</li>
                        <li>This is especially important for SCLC patients, who often require frequent imaging, such as PET (discussed later on), to track the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.</li>
                        <li>Thus, the combined exposure over time can increase the risk of long-term side effects, such as a slightly higher chance of developing other cancers later in life.</li>
                        <li>However, this risk is generally small compared to the immediate benefits of accurately diagnosing and treating SCLC.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What are some benefits and drawbacks of using chest X-rays for diagnosing SCLC?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any X-ray view required in radiography is painless, quick, and non-invasive, typically taking only a few minutes to complete.</li>
                <li>There are no immediate side effects from the radiation used in a single CXR.</li>
                <li>An advantage of using CXR to diagnose SCLC is that a resulting radiograph can reveal large masses, fluid buildup, or other abnormalities in the lungs that may indicate SCLC.</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>However, some studies have indicated that CXR is less effective at detecting small tumours or early-stage SCLC (Bradley et al., 2019).</li>
                    <li>This can lead to delayed diagnosis, which is concerning given the aggressive nature of SCLC.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>CXRs provide limited information about whether the cancer has spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body.</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Advanced imaging like CT or PET scans are required for staging.</li>
                    <li>Studies demonstrated that approximately 90% of missed lung cancer cases occur on CXR.</li>
                    <li>This is often attributed to factors such as misinterpretation of pathological findings as normal, the size and location of tumours, and variations in the skill level of those interpreting the radiograph (Del Ciello et al., 2017).</li>
                    <li>CXRs sometimes produce false positives, such as mistaking benign conditions for cancer, or false negatives, such as failing to detect small tumours. This can lead to unnecessary follow-up tests or overlooked diagnoses.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

        <!-- Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Section -->
        <div class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">
            <h2>Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Positron emission tomography (PET) also serves as another imaging modality that can help detect the presence of SCLC tumour cells or any possible spread to other parts of the body of the patient (Treadwell et al., 2016).</p>

            <h3>Is PET safe for my body?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PET uses ionizing radiation and radiotracers to localize positron-emitting radioisotopes in the body, which are key for showing the SCLC tumour on a PET scan image.</li>
                <li>An example of many of the radiotracers used would be Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG).</li>
                <li>Radiotracers emit gamma rays, which are a form of ionizing radiation (World Nuclear Association, 2025).</li>
                <li>18F-FDG has a short half-life of less than 2 hours. This means that it does not remain in the body for too long and can be evacuated through urine and stool, which contributes to the safety of undergoing PET scans.</li>
                <li>Therefore, there is no significant effect from radiation from a single PET scan.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What can PET bring to SCLC patients?</h3>
            <p>An advantage of using PET with the 18F-FDG radiotracer would be the ability to distinguish tumours such as SCLC from nodules or masses, which are often mistaken for tumours or other pathologies and cannot be detected with other imaging modalities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>However, a disadvantage of PET would be that the resulting images would not be able to show the necessary anatomical details that would help the doctor diagnose a patient.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How can PET be combined with other imaging modalities?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Usually, a PET scan can be combined with other imaging modalities and performed at the same time, such as CT, creating what is called a PET-CT scan (Treadwell et al., 2016).</li>
                <li>A PET-CT scan would compensate with the necessary anatomical details that would not be demonstrated if PET alone were used.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why is SCLC often found after it has spread and what role PET scans play to help spot any pathologies?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Research has shown that SCLC is a very aggressive type of cancer, which means it tends to spread to other parts of the body quite quickly, even in early stages (Decoster et al., 2008).</li>
                <li>By the time SCLC is diagnosed, in about 7 out of 10 people, the cancer has already spread to multiple sites, making it harder to treat.</li>
                <li>Due to the metastatic nature of SCLC as a cancer, SCLC patients may have an elevated 18F-FDG activity on PET scans in a certain area.</li>
                <li>This means that those areas are using a lot of glucose (sugar). This is called being “FDG-avid.”
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is not something to worry about as being FDG-avid is only a term to indicate that cancer is present, but sometimes it could just be inflammation, an infection, or other pathologies within the patient (Hofman & Hicks, 2016).</li>
                        <li>For example, in the same study by Hofman & Hicks (2016), an early-stage (T1N0) patient had an 18F-FDG lesion in their lower right abdomen.
                            <ul>
                                <li>This simply means that the PET scan picked up a spot with increased activity, which might need further investigation, but is not necessarily alarming on its own.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>As a result, cancer cells will show up as bright spots on PET scan images.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Concerns that You May Have:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is very common for patients to be afraid of getting a PET scan immediately after learning that it involves ionizing radiation.</li>
                <li>The amount of radiation a patient can be exposed to during a PET scan is in the range of 8 mSv (millisieverts) for adults, which is approximately the same as the radiation expected to be received naturally from the sun (Kapoor & Kasi, 2022).</li>
                <li>Pregnant women should avoid these scans unless absolutely necessary because the radiation could harm the fetus or embryo, especially if during the pre-implantation stage of pregnancy.</li>
                <li>Breastfeeding mothers should stay away from babies and pregnant individuals for about 12 hours after undergoing a PET scan.</li>
                <li>Lactating women are required to throw out breast milk for the first 12 hours. After 24 hours, it is generally safe to breastfeed again.</li>
                <li>Risks of PET:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The risk of PET is considered low or modest compared to the benefits it provides in the diagnosis and treatment of pathologies.</li>
                        <li>Scientists have also shown that patients with SCLC (specifically limited stage) who had undergone a PET scan had shown better disease control and longer survival compared to non-PET staged SCLC patients (Xanthopoulos et al., 2013).</li>
                        <li>Your doctor would normally weigh this small risk against the need for accurate medical information to guide treatment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Prepare for a PET Scan and What to Expect?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Two days before your PET scan appointment: No intense exercises or deep-tissue massages (Cedars-Sinai, 2025).</li>
                <li>One day before: No sugary or starchy foods like bread, pasta, or rice.</li>
                <li>On the day: Don't eat or drink for 6 hours before, except plain water or medications.</li>
                <li>Bring your doctor’s requisition (if they give you one).</li>
                <li>Leave jewelry, metals, hairclips, dental appliances, and important stuff at home. You can bring your glasses (if you wear one) but you will have to remove them.</li>
                <li>A PET procedure starts with the technologist introducing a positron-emitting radiotracer in the vein of the patient, which accumulates in the target tissue (Kapoor & Kasi, 2022). Then, the PET scanner will rotate around the patient to produce images of areas inside the body where the radiotracer has taken up.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The resulting PET image produced would help the doctor to detect, diagnose, or stage SCLC, offering appropriate treatment.</li>
                        <li>You might feel temporary minor discomfort at the site of radiotracer injection or a warm sensation after it is injected (Cleveland Clinic, 2022). Allergic reactions are rare but can occur.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A PET scan usually takes approximately 1 hour to complete (Cedars-Sinai, 2025).</li>
