            <h2>Risk Management</h2>
            <p>There are several ways to manage risks in SCLC diagnostics and procedures.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>What Can Doctors and Hospital Staff Do?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abide by ALARA Principle:</strong> Technologies should adjust the machine settings so that every patient gets the clearest and most diagnostic images with the least amount of radiation. Assume that any radiation exposure carries some risk, so always aim to reduce unnecessary exposure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Retakes:</strong> Technologists need to ensure that patients are correctly positioned, so that there is no need to take extra scans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use of Shielding:</strong> Patients and staff can wear lead aprons or thyroid shielding to protect certain body parts from extra exposure, preventing further damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treatment Plans:</strong> Doctors and technologists should adjust radiation and chemotherapy based on the patient’s health and cancer stage. Special considerations should be made for pregnant patients, and they should avoid any procedure that involves radiation unless absolutely necessary. For instance, if delaying imaging or procedure would harm the mother’s health. Your doctor would discuss treatment and diagnosis that would best work for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choosing the Right Treatment Option:</strong> Doctors can use radiotherapy carefully to control local disease while minimizing damage to healthy lung tissue. They can also adjust the dose if needed to prevent severe toxicity to the body as a whole.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>What Can Patients Do?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Know What Previous Diagnostic Procedures You Have Done:</strong> CT scans, PET scans, X-rays, and radiation therapy help with diagnosis and treatment, but too many can add unnecessary radiation exposure. You could let your doctor know to see if you required the same treatment or diagnostic to prevent repeats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow Directions:</strong> Follow breathing and positioning instructions, medications, or any other instructions provided by the doctor or technologist for a better diagnosis, treatment outcome, and reduced side effects (if any).</li>
                    <li><strong>Strengthen Your Immune System:</strong> Stay hydrated, practice good hygiene, avoid getting too close to people who smoke, stay positive, practice light exercise, and sleep well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay on Top of Your Doctor/Treatment Appointments:</strong> Since SCLC tends to spread quickly, keep an eye on any new or worsening symptoms and schedule a visit with your doctor to talk about them. Remember that missing early detection or delaying treatment can worsen prognosis.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>All of these risk management options would help you make the right decision about what works best for you. Ideally, doctors would be able to choose the safest and most effective treatment based on your health needs. This way, you can get the best care while minimizing harm, avoiding unnecessary radiation, and reducing side effects as much as possible.</p>
