                        <p>There are many methods our radiographic procedures ensure radiation safety for the patients.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use of Lead</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We provide both lead aprons and lead collars when appropriate during radiographic exams.</li>
                                    <li>The lead, around 0.5mm thick, is capable of reducing scatter radiation by about 90% (Cheon et al., 2018).</li>
                                    <li>Radiographic procedures themselves are rather low doses of radiation (range), so effects are already unlikely (Hall & Giaccia, 2019).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Distance</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Inverse-square law (Lakhwani et al., 2018)
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The intensity of the X-ray beam is proportional to the reciprocal of the distance squared.</li>
                                            <li>The further away someone is from the radiation source, the lower the intensity of radiation they receive.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Radiation technologists try their best to optimize distance so there is sufficient exposure for good image quality while minimizing dose to patients.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Fractionation</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Primarily used in radiation therapy rather than radiography.</li>
                                    <li>Fractionating dose delivery allows for cells to recover while the area of interest still receives a sufficient dose for treatment (Hall & Giaccia, 2019).</li>
                                    <li>This limits the effects on surrounding tissues, while effectively targeting the treatment area.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>ALARA Principle</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is the “As Low As Reasonably Achievable” principle, where hospitals and radiation workers work to limit exposure to patients as much as possible without compromising image quality.</li>
                                    <li>A study conducted by Safrullah et al. (2017) concluded that around 99% of hospitals that completed their survey recognized the ALARA principle.</li>
                                    <li>84% affirmed the beneficial use of lead protection (Safrullah et al., 2017).</li>

                <h2>Radiation Therapy</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>If you’ve been diagnosed with SCLC, one of your possible treatment options is radiation therapy. You may or may not be eligible for radiation therapy as the treatment for each individual varies. However, if you are interested in radiation therapy and how it affects you as a patient, this section explains the basics.</p>
    
                <h3>What is External Beam Radiation Therapy?</h3>
                <p>See the following video for what to expect from radiation therapy treatment: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" target="_blank">What to Expect During Radiation Treatment | Winship Cancer Institute</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Radiation therapy utilizes ionizing radiation to kill as many tumour cells as possible and eradicate cancer.</li>
                    <li>Uses higher energy photons than in diagnostic x-ray: energy ranges from approx. 4-20 MeV.</li>
                    <li>Exposed to a much higher dose of radiation than diagnostic x-ray: prescribed dose depends on treatment site and tumour size.</li>
                    <li>Linear accelerators (LINACs) are designed to accelerate electrons to high speeds and produce higher energy photons designed for treatment purposes.</li>
                    <li>This is what a typical LINAC looks like:
                </ul>
                <img src="images/linac.png" alt="Linear Accelerator" class="symptom-image">

                    </li>
                    <li>Precise techniques are used during treatment planning and setup to ensure minimal dose is received by healthy tissue and large dose is received by cancerous cells.</li>
                    <li>CT simulation is used to determine the position you will be in for all of your treatments and take 3D images of the target anatomy for reference during planning and treatment to ensure accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>What is Fractionation?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A large dose is split up into multiple smaller doses over a designated period of time.</li>
                    <li>Example: total prescribed dose of 45 Gy, delivered over 30 fractions (split up into 30 smaller doses); therefore each fraction is 1.5 Gy.</li>
                    <li>Allows for repair of healthy tissue before the next dose is delivered.</li>
                    <li>How is more repair allowed with a smaller dose?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Theory is that a smaller dose results in less breaks of the DNA per unit volume.</li>
                            <li>Less breaks = less surface area for incorrect joining (smaller amount of dangerous aberrations).</li>
                            <li>More correct rejoining of chromosomes is likely, due to the small number of broken chromosomes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>What is IMRT?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) utilizes beams varying in intensity to provide the tumour with the most accurate dose.</li>
                    <li>The radiation therapy linear accelerator continuously rotates around the table (and you) while beam-shaping devices (called multi-leaf collimators) shape the beam to the target (tumour).</li>
                    <li>This is what a typical IMRT setup looks like:
                 </ul>
                <img src="images/imrt.png" alt="IMRT Setup" class="symptom-image">

                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Doses Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current standard doses from Daly et al. (2021):
                        <ul>
                            <li>45 Gy, delivered over 30 fractions, and given twice daily (each fraction = 1.5 Gy), given 3 Gy in one day.</li>
                            <li>60-70 Gy, delivered over 30-35 fractions, given once daily (each fraction = 2.0 Gy), given 2 Gy in one day.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>How is my Body Affected?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Side effects depend on MANY factors, some effects may be reduced if you are receiving chemotherapy or have a smaller treatment field (tumour).</li>
                    <li>Skin (signs and symptoms begin appearing 2-3 weeks after the start treatment): erythema (redness), dryness, pigmentation changes, fibrosis (late stages), temporary hair loss (where radiation enters the body).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Temporary hair loss occurs approximately 3 weeks after an exposure to 3-6 Gy, with regrowth beginning approximately 2 months after radiation treatment is completed (Bushberg et al., 2020).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Lymphocytes (WBCs): temporary decreased count = decreased immune system (more prone to acquiring infections, viruses, etc.).</li>
                    <li>GI System: oesophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus mucosal wall) = sore throat, difficulty swallowing.</li>
                    <li>Lung Structures: pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue) and a dry non-productive cough (resulting from irritation of trachea and bronchus) are both considered chronic or late effects (Washington et al., 2021).</li>
                    <li>Heart Problems - swelling of tissue surrounding the heart: pain, abnormal heart rhythm (late effects).</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>What is PCI?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) may be used for patients with higher stages of SCLC to reduce the risk of brain metastases.</li>
                    <li>You may not be eligible for PCI if: you are older than 60, you have neurocognitive impairment or have a poor general performance status.</li>
                    <li>It is important to note that approximately 60% of patients with tumours located in the thorax develop metastases in the brain (Suwinski, 2021).</li>
                    <li>Your oncologist will order MRI or PET images of your brain to look for any signs of cancer that is present but difficult to detect via imaging.</li>
                    <li>If your oncologist decides that you do not need PCI, you will still need multiple follow-up MRIs to ensure no spread has occurred.</li>
                    <li>This is what a typical PCI setup looks like:
                 </ul>
                 <img src="images/pci.png" alt="PCI Setup" class="symptom-image">

                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Doses Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current standard dose from Suwinski (2021):
                        <ul>
                            <li>25 Gy delivered over 10 fractions, given once daily (each fraction = 2.5 Gy).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>How is my Body Affected?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decline in memory may be observed at approximately 1 year post-irradiation (Suwinski, 2021).</li>
                    <li>Fatigue, appetite loss, nausea, and leg weakness for up to 3 months due to temporary swelling of brain tissue as an acute response to radiation (Edelman, 2020).</li>
                    <ul>
                     
                        <li>However, neuropsychological impairment could be connected to the cancer itself or to treatment given before PCI (Péchoux et al., 2016).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Improvements have been made to significantly reduce dose to critical structures such as the hippocampus.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whole-brain irradiation for brain metastases while sparing the hippocampus was associated with the preservation of memory and quality of life and these practices may be introduced into PCI to lessen the side effects and improve quality of life (Péchoux et al., 2016).</li>
                            <li>Hippocampus plays an important part in brain injury repair, so sparing this portion of the brain from radiation is important.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>When considering treatment for cancer, it is always important to weigh the costs and benefits of a specific procedure. Radiation therapy for the treatment of lung cancer has been used for several decades and proven to be a reliable treatment option. Although there are side effects involved with receiving radiation, the effectiveness of radiation at eradicating cancer outweighs the cost of these side effects. Your healthcare team of radiation therapists and oncologists will provide you with the most superior care and assist you with side effect management and treatment for any radiation associated side effects.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Pneumonitis can arise due to multiple causal factors, so it is important to receive proper assessments to rule out other reasons for acute respiratory distress (Majeed & Gupta, 2023).</li>
                            <li>Corticosteroids can help reduce pulmonary inflammation in cases of pneumonia (Stern et al., 2017).</li>
                            <li>It can also be used for cases of inflammation, nausea, and vomiting (Anderson et al., 2021).</li>
                            <li><strong>Common corticosteroids include:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dexamethasone (Decadron)</li>
                                    <li>Methylprednisolone (Medrol)</li>
                                    <li>Prednisone</li>
                                    <li>Hydrocortisone</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Should be used sparingly due to its addictive properties (Majeed & Gupta, 2023).
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Decrease consumption amount/dosage of corticosteroids throughout usage (starting high but decreasing over time).</li>
                                </ul>
